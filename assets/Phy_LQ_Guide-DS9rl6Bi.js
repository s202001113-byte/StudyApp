(4 marks)`,answer:`When the switch is closed, current flows through the coil inside a magnetic field, *there are magnetic forces* acting on *wires* to *rotate the coil* and the coil and the coil turns *clockwise*. (1)
When the coil turns to the *vertical position*, the *turning effect becomes zero*. Due to inertia, the coil shoots through the vertical position to the other side. (1)
The direction of the *turning effect* acting on the coil *reverses* and the coil rotates back in the anticlockwise direction. This process repeats. (1)
As *energy is lost against friction* during the motion, the coil will finally stop in the vertical position. (1)`,hasImage:!0},{id:`ch4_4_q6`,question:`Explain the use of soft iron core in an electric motor. (2 marks)`,answer:`Soft iron is a *magnetic material* (1)

The coil is connected to a d.c. supply by a switch S. When the switch is closed, the aluminium ring placed on the top of the coil jumps up momentarily and falls back. Explain this phenomenon. (3 marks)`,answer:`When S is closed, the current flows in the coil and *produce increasing magnetic flux*. (1)
By *Lenz's law*, an *induced emf* is created in the ring to *oppose the change* (1)
thus it jumps up momentarily. When the *current reaches steady value*, no change in magnetic flux results in fall back of the ring.
